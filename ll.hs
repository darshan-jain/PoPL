 A simple linked list module
  Some examples: 
	mylist = (Cons 10 (Cons 99 (Cons 11 (Cons 1 MyNil))))
	myHead myList                       # => 10
	myTail myList                       # => Cons 99 (Cons 11 (Cons 1 MyNil))
	myLength myList               # => 4
	myToList myList               # => [10,99,11,1]
	myFromList [10,99,11,1]       # => (Cons 10 (Cons 99 (Cons 11 (Cons 1 MyNil))))
	myIndex 2 myList              # => 11
	myMapList (\x -> x*x) myList  # => Cons 100 (Cons 9801 (Cons 121 (Cons 1 MyNil)))
